# unity-rpg
An open-source game that I will be working on. This is an RPG style adventure game. Feel free to branch off and change the code, contribute and share ideas, or use the game's code in your personal projects!

### How to use unity-rpg
unity-rpg is made with Unity (no shit). If you want to make your own game based off of this code, you can use any version newer than the version of Unity detailed in the version section. If you want to contribute code, or just help with the game design in general, you have to use the version of Unity detailed in the version section.
If you do use this in your game, please credit me.

### Unity Version
I use Unity Personal 2018.4.36f1. 

If there are enough requests to upgrade to a specific version newer than 2018, I will, as I do not want to discriminate people from contributing because of a version of Unity.
